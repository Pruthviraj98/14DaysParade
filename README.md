# 14DaysParade

Creating this repository for anyone who wants to Leetcode with me. 
Doing this to have a collaborative environment and learn together

Steps - 

1. Fork this repo locally -

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Pruthviraj98/14DaysParade.git
    ```

2. Go to https://github.com/users/Pruthviraj98/projects/2 and assign yourself a ticket for the day (DO NOT REMOVE OTHER ASSIGNEES)

3. Create your branch locally in the following format:
   ```
   git checkout -b "problems/<firstInitial><LastInitial>/<Date in format ddmmyyy>"
   ```

   NOTE: If you contributing for the first time, create your folder and add your problem files there.
   NOTE: Make sure to pull and push the commit

4. FYI - You need atleast one approval for merging. Add me as a reviewer at the least. Thank you!


NOTE: DO NOT create new tickets on the project. I will be creating them every weekends for the following weeks.
NOTE: There is no need to write test cases. Just write the code in your editor to have maximum experience of interviewing and run it on Leetcode or any other platform you like and push
NOTE: If the problems are of premium version, if possible add test cases locally. No pressure.
